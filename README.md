## BMI Calculatort
This is a simple responsive BMI calculator using react js. And i think you must learn something from this small project. We used use state hook to manage the state of the application.

# What Is BMI ?
Let's first understand what BMI is before we dive into the development of the BMI calculator. BMI, or Body Mass Index, is a measurement used to assess a person's leanness or obesity based on their height and weight. While there are many tools available to calculate your BMI, in this project, we build our very own BMI calculator.
